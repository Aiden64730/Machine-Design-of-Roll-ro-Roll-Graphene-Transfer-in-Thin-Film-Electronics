# Machine Design of Roll-to-Roll Graphene Transfer in Thin Film Electronics
## Research Assistant (University of Texas at Austin)

•	Designed a roll-to-roll transfer platform with multiple speed, tension and camera sensors, refined the manufacturing process to minimize quality degradation during mechanical peeling of 2D materials

•	Led system-level design, process integration, characterization and dynamics modeling of the process

•	Systematically explored the polymer coating, film lamination and delamination process of graphene transfer

•	Performed statistical analysis of a large data set using Python and identified the optimal loading condition

•	Applied the roll-to-roll manufacturing process for biodegradable graphene sensors for wearable electronics
